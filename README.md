# Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy and Locomotion

Using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) to generate animations for creatures in a land-based physical simulation. 

I built a variety of creatures using the Dynamimc Animation and Robotics Toolkit (DART), including a 3 segment worm, a spider, a quadruped, and a quadruped with wide feet. I modeled the movement of each joint along the necessary axes using periodic functions. Each
